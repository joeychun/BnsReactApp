    "text": "Investing in cryptocurrency is not only a means of earning money. Rather, it is a life-changer, a source of excitement, and an obsession.\nWithout a doubt, lucky investment in cryptocurrency can grant investors instant, effortless wealth. These “rags-to-riches” stories of Bitcoin millionaires frequently fill up internet communities and may lure people into irrationally investing into crypto.\nYet most investors are not ignorant of the risks accompanying cryptocurrency. Indeed, Bitcoin failure stories constantly swarm around the internet as much as success stories do––but that fact does not stop the crypto fever.\nSo why do people still invest massive amounts in cryptocurrency?\nAccording to experts, crypto investment, similarly to gambling, is highly addictive.\nFor one thing, investment accompanies pleasure––the brain releases dopamine at moments of profit, and this conditions the brain into craving more of the enjoyment. Just as in the casino, the bigger the gain, the bigger the thrill. Thus investors hardly sell at opportunities of earning small gains but rather wait for “jackpots”.\nAnother factor that plays a role is cryptocurrency’s fluctuating nature. In situations where the reward is uncertain, gambling studies have shown that the brain releases high amounts of dopamine, resulting in an addiction. Cryptocurrency prices, similarly to gambling, are highly unpredictable, causing the investors to return for more.\nEven during times of crypto price crashes, investors still tend to hold on to their cryptocurrency, carrying on the potential danger of even bigger losses. The psychological explanation behind this behavior is risk seeking: although many averse risk in most situations, when people are guaranteed a sure loss, they become risk-seekers and take gambles in hopes of losing nothing. Due to this human tendency, many investors experience huge losses from not withdrawing at an early stage.\nWhile profit may be the fundamental reason for investment, the social inclusiveness people feel by engaging in cryptocurrency is another factor.\nMany online crypto communities exist on platforms including Twitter, TikTok, and Reddit. Investors find significance in being part of those groups and possessing their own identity in the finance world. And research has shown that when people discuss their investments in social media, they tend to seek more risks in their investments. Celebrities posting about their cryptocurrency in their media may also make people more open-minded to high-stakes investment.\nThe summation of these various components of crypto’s nature often blindsight investors, causing them to fall into the vicious cycle of taking bigger, irrational risks and detrimental losses.\nTo escape this cycle, investors could consider the option of quitting cryptocurrency engagement before an addiction emerges. After all, it may not be wise for investors to buy digital coins if they do not have expertise or knowledge in the field.\nBut, at the bare minimum, it is crucial that investors be conscious of their actions at all moments: they must know the potential risks of their investments and constantly self-check whether they are developing an addiction––before it becomes too late."
